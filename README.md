## üìã Setup

1. ‚≠ê Star and `clone` or download this repository.
<br><br>
2. **Patch** your system using [SecureUXTheme](https://github.com/namazso/SecureUxTheme) or [UltraUXThemePatcher](https://mhoefs.eu/software_uxtheme.php?lang=en)
<br><br>
3. Apply the below configuration to [OldNewExplorer](https://msfn.org/board/topic/170375-oldnewexplorer-119/) if you are using it. (Recommended, but optional)<br><br>![OldNewExplorerCfg](./OldNewExplorerCfg.png)
<br><br>
4. Move all the contents of the folder `ThemePack` to `C:\Windows\Resources\Themes`
<br><br>
5. Run `icon.reg` that was in the `ThemePack` folder to apply the icons. Alternatively, you can run the `7tsp Linuxfx-11-AIO.7tsp` icon pack from the Icons folder. This pack though is preferred for the `Windows 12-Sweet` Theme. (Credits to niivu)
<br><br>
6. Run the file `Windows 12.theme` and wait. After 15-20 seconds, you should see your computer looks change.
<br><br>
7. Finally, reboot your computer to see the final result.
